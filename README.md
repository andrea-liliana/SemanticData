# Semantic Data Project 

Development of an ontology-based knowledge base about ecology and endangered species in OWL and using the Protégé editor. This project involves:

- Manually querying the ontology through queries in Manchester syntax, entered in the DL Query tool of the editor Protégé. And through SPARQL queries addressed through a SPARQL GUI.
- The ontology is used through a JAVA program using the JENA API (able to interact with the ontology at the RDFS level in order ro manage it and to query it with SPARQL queries) and a JAVA program using the OWL API (able to interact with the ontology at the OWL level in order to manage ir, and to call a reasoner to perform inferences bases on the ontology).
